# Frontend

### Prerequisites
- The JavaScript runtime, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- A package manager, I prefer [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) but [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is OK too.

## Installing
- Run ```npm install```, it may take a while.

### Running the app
Run ```npm start```, the app then should be running on port ```3001```.
